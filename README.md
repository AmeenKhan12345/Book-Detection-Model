# Book Detection and Text Extraction for Visually Impaired Individuals
## Overview:
This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals in accessing printed materials by detecting books using computer vision and extracting text from them. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for book detection and pytesseract for text extraction.

## Key Features:
- Detects books in real-time using a webcam feed.
- Extracts text from detected books using pytesseract OCR.

## Project Details:
### Model Accuracy: 
- The CNN model's accuracy is currently low but can be improved with a better dataset and minor adjustments.
### Future Work: 
- Plan to integrate the extracted text with an API to detect the book in database and to provide the summary and key points as speech output.
## Usage:
- Run the Final_Code.py file to start the webcam feed and detect books.
- Press 'q' to exit the webcam feed.
